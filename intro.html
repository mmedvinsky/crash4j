       Crash4j is an engine and a platform used to perform fault tolerance testing .  
       The importance of fault-tolerance testing becomes more prominent as complexity of your production environment grows.  
       As we have seen almost exponential growth in system layers and their inter-dependencies the need to understand 
       the fault bearing capabilities of each individual system participant is very important. 
       <p/>
       All systems can be classified into 3 main categories, as they are measured for fault tolerance:
       <table>
         <tr><td>Unrecoverable</td><td>Recoverable</td><td>Fault Tolerant</td></tr>    
         <tr><td>The system experiences a period of instability and is unable to recover from it. 
Recover involves, restarting, reconfiguring or fixing the system
</td><td>The system experiences a period of instability and is able to recover from it and continue operating with the same SLA as before the instability took place</td>
<td>The system experiences instability but is able to carry on with operations in acceptable way, despite instability.</td></tr>
       </table>
